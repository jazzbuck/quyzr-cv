<p>Good Practice Data Scientist at the Office for National Statistics, former fast stream statistician, former opera producer.</p>

<p>Prior to this I worked at the Ministry of Justice informing policy with new economic models, and the Ministry of Defence, leading a programme of statistical work, data pipeline innovation, and analysis for a change programme. I also worked on showing early machine learning value, predominantly using boosted gradient and random forest models.</p>

<p>I currently focus on consulting analysts in government to adopt software engineering practices in their models. I collect good practice examples of automated models and new data science techniques.</p>

<p>Interested in economic research, particularly focussed on long-term sustainability, risk management, network science, information asymmetry, normative uncertainty, and bounded rationality behaviour.</p>
