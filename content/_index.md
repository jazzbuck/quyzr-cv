<p>Fast stream statistician, former opera producer, currently working for the Ministry of Justice.</p>

<p>Prior to this I worked at the Ministry of Defence, leading a programme of statistical work, data pipeline innovation, and analysis for a change programme. 
I also worked on showing early machine learning value, predominantly using boosted gradient and random forest models.</p>

<p>I currently focus on informing decision-makers in government with new economic models and data-driven narratives. 
I lead the Assistant Statisticians' Committee with a particular aim to improve learning & development opportunities with a view to preparing government for DataOps.
I act as keyholder for analysis at the Ministry of Justice, which requires me to evaluate models which support business cases.</p>

<p>Interested in economic research, particularly focussed on long-term sustainability, risk management, information asymmetry, normative uncertainty, and non-expected-utility-maximising behaviour.</p>
